# Visiting San Francisco
You're visiting the bay and staying in SF? Here's what we recommend to do. We live on the western side of Buena Vista park in the Ashbury Heights area, which biases a lot of the things we do for ease of access and travel, but we personally approve all of these activities.

## Required Activities
These are musts for visiting San Francisco; preferably to do with us, but acceptable to do on your own.

### Twin Peaks
Tallest point in the city where the iconic skyline resident, Mt. Sutro tower, is found. Intense walk up to the top from our house, but it's absolutely worth it. You can also drive up, less fun. I feed the ravens there occasionally, they'll hang out if you have granola or nuts. Panoramic views of the city only when it's not enveloped in fog so make sure you can see mt. sutro out your window before walking up.

### Land's End
A national landmark at the north-west tip of the city. Some of the best views you can possibly imagine, its a gorgeous hiking ground around the coast along cliffs and rocky beaches. The parking lot has a view of Sutro Baths and the beach, a simple stop. Recommend to hike it along the coast to get insane views of the Golden Gate Bridge.

### Tartine & Botanical Gardens
The entrance to the botanical gardens is super close to Tartine in the Sunset. The line at Tartine doesn't get bad until late morning, and the Botanical Gardens is free entrance before 9am; grabbing pastries before 9 and eating them in the gardens is one of my favorite activities.

### Dandelion Chocolate
Either the tour of the Mission District factory, or just going to the retail store on Valencia, this place is required imo. Best chocolate I've ever had; it's all like single-origin chocolate with only two ingredients. The tour is fun if you can, but if you can't make it, you have to get a hot chocolate, cookie, and at least one other thing from the Valencia store. Sample the chocolate while you wait, and get extra marshmallows which are the best part.
<br>

- [Dandelion Factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GBCRh2reVhHxnLMZ7) - Tours are $20 a head and you get a coupon for a free drink
- [Dandelion Retail Location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2QTHVq8213g5wQYF8) - their packaged stuff makes for a great gift, too.

### Golden Gate Park
This park is bigger than Central Park and has so much to do. I could hang out in the park for days. Head to the park for these necessary activities
<br>

- [Bison Paddock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q8yipcuN351jYWwB7) - See the bison!
- [Conservatory of Flowers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X8tNajyUUCJWHV6D9) - audio tour is available to buy on the CloudGuide app; it's worth the $1.99 if you're a nerd. I'm also a docent there so I can teach about everything
- [Walk the JFK Promenade, starting point near us](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aQuXELMiahFvKyDh6) - a lot of cool art installations along the road closed to cars
- More in recommended below

### The Alamo Drafthouse
There are Alamos in many US cities, so if you haven't gone, check this one out. Nothing beats table-side service for beer and pub food while you watch movies. They also play a lot of classic, indie, and cult classics here.

## Required Food
What food we most highly recommend
<br>

- [Tartine (Sunset location)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nen7Cq3a3pXsBNci7) - best pastries around, we recommend ham croissant and almond croissant
- [Ebisu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SrSxWRG2AdAdrGdV9) - Our favorite sushi, we recommend any fresh fish and the miso eggplant
- [Sandy's Muffuletta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N7imXDxEYw2HEaPj7) - New Orleans-style sandwich, recommend getting 1/8th of both veggie and meat muffs.
- [La Taq](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kswFTKFtMFTwHoJo6) - Best burritos in the US, the line can be crazy. Closed M/Tu
- [Dumpling Home](https://maps.app.goo.gl/btHvqX4mVs43zMnz6) - long waits some nights, but panfried dumplings are a must

## Highly Recommended Activities
Things we think you should do, but not a big deal to miss.

### Golden Gate Park con't
The things that we think are recommended but not required per se.
<br>

- [Cal Academy of Sciences](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vwMg1pEJw7cLLvPT8) - $20 ticket price, but theres a lepidoptery to hang with a bunch of butterflies and an albino alligator (so i've heard)
- [De Young Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2ZXBqu3cTYYck8gM7) - famous muesum in the park
- [Tea Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qU6xmXMebf81Vfo18) - Same umbrella as SFBG and Conservatory, not as nerdy and exciting but still pretty.

### Buena Vista park
A gorgeous park made up of forests and hills. Hard to reach the top, but worth it. Old gravestones from when the dead were moved to Colma, CA are used to pave the gutters of the park, you can see "Here lies" and other bits of headstone engravings.
